            It is a fast-paced thriller involving Harvard professor of religious symbology Robert Langdon, 
            who must solve a murder mystery before he is arrested for the murder himself. While the plot moves 
            along rapidly, the narrative and dialogue slow down briefly at times to explore weighty issues and 
            consider controversial  religious questions. Did Constantine the Great and the Council of Nicaea establish 
            the divinity of Jesus Christ in 325 A.D.? Was Leonardo da Vinci one of the "keepers of the secret of the 
            Holy Grail," as Leigh Teabing, the historian scholar, declares?
